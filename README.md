# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project

Implement a 3x3 board with a 2D array.
Display the board to the user.
Accept user input for moves alternately between Player X and Player O.
Validate moves to prevent overwriting cells.
Check win conditions after each move.
Check for draw condition if the board is full without a winner.
Loop until a win or draw occurs.
Display appropriate messages, including the winner or draw state.
Reset the game or exit after one game finishes is optional but not requested, so I will keep the game finishing after one round. I will create a single C++ source file with the full implementation.
